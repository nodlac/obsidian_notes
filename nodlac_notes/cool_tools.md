# Cool Tools 

## Obsidian
- NVIM + Obsidian is awesome makes editing them so much easier.
- Love that I have partition out so I can have different files and links to the files I feel like I'm going to be a lot more organized now.`


## Open Code
- Want to explore other clis but so far best I've used so far 
- other options 
    - Gemini
    - Claude
    - openai

## Aerospace 
- Awesome transition into tile window manager.
- easy to setup and makes me so much more productive. It's the thing I didn't know I needed
- Honestly, made we want to dive in deeper to linux

## Neovim
- Took me a while to figure out and to be honest I'm still drinking from a fire hose.
- Much nicer way to edit text and if you can get used to the keybinds you almost don't even need a mouse

## Tmux
- CHANGED MY LIFE
- The only way to use a terminal
